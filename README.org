Goal is to get [[https://github.com/sulami/literate-calc-mode.el][literate-calc]] working in org-src-like blocks within other modes,
using [[https://polymode.github.io/][Polymode]]

* WIP

- Working: chunking in polymode, with org-mode as host. Switching between major
  modes as we transition b/w chunks.
- *Problem*: There is currently leakage of state between the literate-calc chunk
  and the host chunks, see [[file:test.org][test.org]]
- TODO: eval-region functions (problem here is that eval-buffer does things
  line-by-line, would have to rewrite that)

* Usage

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! poly-literate-calc
  :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/poly-literate-calc" :build (:not compile)));; :host github :repo "indigoviolet/poly-literate-calc"))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! poly-literate-calc)
#+end_src
